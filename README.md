## [F.A.Q](#faq)
*Here is a short FAQ with the most common questions one mostly asks about.*

### Are all maps and heroes covered?
Yes, all the maps and heroes found in Overwatch 2 are fully covered. Hero information is fetched from [OverFast API](https://overfast-api.tekrop.fr/) frequently, while maps are fully covered by myself. Feel free to contribute with map information by opening a new [issue](https://github.com/Electrocute4u/Kiriko/issues).

### Player search?
You can use the `/player search` to search for any user matching a `username` (without #xxxxx discriminator) to obtain a list with all users matching that. Or you can directly get the Career profile of a user, by using their `Battletag` with the `/player profile` slash command.

### I can't find my Career Profile?
First, the Battletag is __CAsE__ sensetive, meaning it has to match indentically with your actual Battletag. If you have any unique characters (i.e H∆êRA#2109), make sure they are also correctly matching with your actual Battletag. If this isn't working, sign in and try your own [career page](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/career/). Should this page display "404 Not Found", the API might have issues trying to display your Career Page. You will sadly have to wait until Blizzard fixes the API sometime in the future.

### What features does this bot have?
Everything is listed in the [Features](#features) section, please take a look there.

### Do the bot have any premium content? Can I support the project?
The bot are currently 100% free to use and have no restrictions on commands as of now. But the system is in place and it may become active in the future.
As for supporting it, any donations are welcome. Feel free to PM **Kiriko#0001** on Discord and we can have a talk.

### How often is there updates?
This is a hobby project and a JavaScript learning ground for me. Personally, I'm not doing coding as a job. So expect frequent updates whenever I have the time and resources. The project is pretty self sustainable as most of it is updated automatically, with occasions where I have to manually step in.
